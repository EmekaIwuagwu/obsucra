## The Opportunity

### The Problem
Decentralized oracles—the infrastructure that feeds real-world data to smart contracts—have a **$5B+ annual market** growing 40% YoY. Yet:

- **Chainlink dominates with 60%+ market share**, creating centralization risk
- **No privacy**: All oracle data is public, exposing trading strategies and RWA portfolios
- **High costs**: On-chain aggregation costs $50k+/month for active protocols
- **Limited RWA support**: Existing oracles lack compliance features for regulated assets

**Real-World Assets (RWA) represent a $50B+ addressable market by 2026**, with tokenized treasuries, real estate, and private credit requiring privacy-preserving, compliant data feeds.

## Our Solution

**Obscura is the first ZK-powered decentralized oracle network** that delivers:

| Feature | Obscura | Chainlink | Pyth |
|---------|---------|-----------|------|
| **ZK Privacy** | ✅ Range proofs, selective disclosure | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Multi-chain** | ✅ 15+ chains | ✅ 10+ chains | ✅ 30+ chains |
| **RWA Support** | ✅ KYC-gated feeds, TWAP proofs | ❌ | ❌ |
| **OCR Consensus** | ✅ 90% gas savings | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Push + Pull Models** | ✅ Both | Push only | Pull only |
| **Open Source** | ✅ MIT/Apache | ❌ | ✅ |

## Key Innovations

### 1. Zero-Knowledge Privacy Layer
- **Range Proofs**: "Treasury yield ∈ [4.5%, 6.2%]" without exposing exact rate
- **Selective Disclosure**: Reveal data only to authorized auditors
- **Proof of Reserves**: Cryptographic attestation of asset backing

### 2. Dual Oracle Architecture
- **Push Model**: <500ms WebSocket streaming for MEV-sensitive DeFi
- **Pull Model**: On-demand with 7-day Merkle proofs for RWA

### 3. Enterprise-Grade Economics
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic verification on >10% price swings
- **OEV Capture**: Protocols reclaim MEV from oracle updates
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Premium push, pay-per-query pull
